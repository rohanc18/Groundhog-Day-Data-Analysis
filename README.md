# Groundhog-Day-Data-Analysis

My team member and I analyzed Groundhog Day data and hypothesized that Punxsutawney Phil does not accurately predict the weather. Using the Python libraries pandas, numpy, and matplotlib, we were able to clean, statically analyze, and display the data. Our results can be found in the Final Project.ipynb file.
